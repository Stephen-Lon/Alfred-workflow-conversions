# Alfred-workflow-conversions
Convert measurements locally (without an Internet connection)

# Introduction

This workflow enables you to convert:

- kilometres to miles
- miles to kilometres
- feet to metres
- metres to feet
- centimetres to inches
- inches to centimetres
- grams to ounces
- ounces to grams
- kilograms to stones
- stones to kilograms
- Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Fahrenheit to Celsius
- square feet to square metres
- square metres to square feet
- litres to pints
- pints to litres
- UK gallons to litres
- litres to UK gallons

There are no dependencies and all calculations are made locally (i.e., you do not need an Internet connection for this workflow).

# Important notes

1. Please note that the conversions may not be absolutely precise (because the results are rounded to two decimal places). For example, if you convert 30,000' to metres the result will be 9,144m. However, if you convert 9,144m to feet the result will be 30,001.46'. Treat the conversions with caution accordingly.

2. When giving the number to convert anything except temperatures you may use comma separators and a decimal point in the number but do not use any letters or other characters. If you do the workflow will produce an error message. When converting temperatures use of the minus sign is allowed.

3. Purely for convenience specific elements of the workflow dealing with temperature conversions are shown coloured red.

4. You can start at any of the length, temperature, area, weight or volume list filters simply by typing any of those words into Alfred (in other words, if you know what units you wish to convert you don't *have* to start at the initial menu).

5. All menus are set so that Alfred learns the result order based on usage so that frequently used menu items will appear at the top of each menu.

# Usage

Type the keyword (the default is `cxv` but you can change it) and follow the menus. After the relevant conversion you have the option of copying the details to the clipboard.
